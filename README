================================================================================

This is the Text::TagTemplate module.

It's designed to make the production of web-based applications such as CGI
programs and Apache::Registry scripts easier and faster, by separating the HTML
coding from the coding of the application logic.  It's also designed to be
flexible, to use a template interface that is simple and easy for
non-programmers to understand, and to be reasonably fast.

There is not much particularly web-specific about it, and indeed it may well
prove useful in other application areas; however, that is the main focus of the
design.

There are other modules that do similar things that you may or may not be
interested in:

	CGI::FastTemplate
	Text::Template
	Text::FillIn

If you know of others, please inform me.

To install this module, you should just be able to do:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

Once you've done that, use ``perldoc Text::TagTemplate'' for more
documentation.  You may be interested in looking at the example CGI application
supplied in the example/ subdirectory, which demonstrates some of the functions
of this module and may help you towards building your first application with
it.

I'd love to hear your suggestions, amendments, comments, bug reports, bug
fixes, and the like.  Direct them to <jacob@well.com>.

If you use this module in a web application, I'd also love to hear about it,
particularly if the web application is also free software.
